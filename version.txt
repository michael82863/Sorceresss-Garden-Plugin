V2.0.0
    This is a continuation of my earlier work on the plugin "Spring Garden". I did this work on a different
        GitHub account that I no longer have access to.


    Changed the overlay to display in relation to region number instead of distance to a world point.


V1.1.0
    Added an OverlayPanel to show time elapsed, success rate, fruit picked, drinks made,
        fruit picked per hour, drinks made per hour, and xp/hr.
    Added SpringGardenSession file to keep track of the all the data from the current session.
    Began preparing to expand the plugin to the other 3 gardens.
    Tweaked some tile activation logic.
    Fixed a stack-trace error from being printed out.

V1.0.0
    Original Commit consisting of basic functions.

V2.0.0
    This is a continuation of my earlier work on the plugin "Spring Garden". I did this work on a different
        GitHub account that I no longer have access to.

    Changed the overlay to display in relation to region number instead of distance to a world point.
    Changed the way the plugin keeps track of the Elemental NPCs and their paths.
    Changed the collision logic for the movement tiles.
    Added a number on the run tiles to show how many more steps it will be until the tile changes color. -Needs work
    Added a toggle to turn the session panel HUD on and off.


V1.1.0
    Added an OverlayPanel to show time elapsed, success rate, fruit picked, drinks made,
        fruit picked per hour, drinks made per hour, and xp/hr.
    Added SpringGardenSession file to keep track of the all the data from the current session.
    Began preparing to expand the plugin to the other 3 gardens.
    Tweaked some tile activation logic.
    Fixed a stack-trace error from being printed out.

V1.0.0
    Original Commit consisting of basic functions.
